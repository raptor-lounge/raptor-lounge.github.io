// file, frame counts/layout can never silently disagree.
//
// Skin overlays (skirt/bodice/necklace/crown) are sheets with the SAME layout, painted
// from the SAME pose records: the runtime keeps them in sync by mirroring the parent's
// frame index every update (layer.frame = player.frame) — layers never play() anything.

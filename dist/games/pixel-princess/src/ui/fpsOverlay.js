// fpsOverlay.js — on-screen FPS / frame-time diagnostics, shown ONLY when the URL carries
// ?fps=1 (or #fps). It exists because the real fluidity of the game can't be measured in
// desktop emulation (Edge/Chromium — see CLAUDE.md) and on Windows there is no Safari Web
// Inspector to read an iPhone's frame timings. Open the deployed game on the device with
// `?fps=1` and this overlay reports what the engine is actually doing.
//
// What it measures (and why it's read from the engine, not from a raw rAF):
//   maxFPS (src/kaplayCtx.js) caps Kaplay's SIMULATION cadence, not the browser's rAF rate —
//   on a 120Hz panel rAF still fires 120×/s even when the game steps at 60. So a naive rAF
//   counter would always read ~120 and hide the cap. Instead we watch k.time(): it only
//   advances on a real engine step, so each change marks one rendered game frame, and k.dt()
//   gives that step's wall-clock delta. From those we derive the true engine fps and the
//   WORST frame delta in the window — the worst delta is the tell for "scattoso": a steady
//   ~16.7ms means even pacing, spikes mean oscillation or GC hitches.
//
// Gated behind the query param so normal players never see it. It creates its own DOM (no
// markup in index.html, no rules in style.css), is pointer-events:none, and never touches
// gameplay/collision logic.
